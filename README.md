Chat application is developed which supports multiple clients (max 10) who can chat with one another.
The messages sent from one client to another client cannot be seen by any other client apart from sender or receiver.
All messages sent by client reach their designated client through the server.
A client can send messages to themselves as well.
Threads are used for handling multiple clients simultaneously.
